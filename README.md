# JavaScript blackjack game

Scrimba project for a simplified blackjack game :)

## Overview

This project utilizes some JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to code a working blackjack game.  

Uses JavaScript to manipulate the DOM ~ Document Object Model

I utilized event listeners to listen for a certain action before dealing cards and updating the score!

### Future challenge

A for money application for blackjack, Poker, or Spades using blockchain to avoid centalized data structures that can be used by bad actors to manipulate players.
